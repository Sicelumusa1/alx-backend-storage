0x00. MySQL advanced

This project covers MySQL advanced topics inclusive of the following:
How to create tables with constraints
How to optimize queries by adding indexes
What is and how to implement stored procedures and functions in MySQL
What is and how to implement views in MySQL
What is and how to implement triggers in MySQL

0. We are all unique!

Write a SQL script that creates a table users following these requirements:

With these attributes:
id, integer, never null, auto increment and primary key
email, string (255 characters), never null and unique
name, string (255 characters)
If the table already exists, your script should not fail
Your script can be executed on any database
Context: Make an attribute unique directly in the table schema will enforced your business rules and avoid bugs in your application

1. In and not out
Write a SQL script that creates a table users following these requirements:

With these attributes:
id, integer, never null, auto increment and primary key
email, string (255 characters), never null and unique
name, string (255 characters)
country, enumeration of countries: US, CO and TN, never null (= default will be the first element of the enumeration, here US)
If the table already exists, your script should not fail
Your script can be executed on any database

2. Best band ever!
Write a SQL script that ranks country origins of bands, ordered by the number of (non-unique) fans

Requirements:

Import this table dump: metal_bands.sql.zip
Column names must be: origin and nb_fans
Your script can be executed on any database
Context: Calculate/compute something is always power intensive… better to distribute the load!

3. Old school band
Write a SQL script that lists all bands with Glam rock as their main style, ranked by their longevity

Requirements:

Import this table dump: metal_bands.sql.zip
Column names must be: band_name and lifespan (in years until 2022 - please use 2022 instead of YEAR(CURDATE()))
You should use attributes formed and split for computing the lifespan
Your script can be executed on any database


4. Buy buy buy
Write a SQL script that creates a trigger that decreases the quantity of an item after adding a new order.

Quantity in the table items can be negative.

Context: Updating multiple tables for one action from your application can generate issue: network disconnection, crash, etc… to keep your data in a good shape, let MySQL do it for you!


5. Email validation to sent
Write a SQL script that creates a trigger that resets the attribute valid_email only when the email has been changed.

Context: Nothing related to MySQL, but perfect for user email validation - distribute the logic to the database itself!
